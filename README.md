**ICanBoogie** is a high-performance micro-framework. It is written with speed, flexibility and
lightness in mind. **ICanBoogie** doesn't try to be an all-in-one do-it-all solution but provides the
essential features to quickly and easily build web applications. It is easily extensible, and a
variety of packages are available to complement its features with [rendering](https://github.com/icanboogie/render), [views](https://github.com/icanboogie/view), [routing](https://github.com/icanboogie/routing),
[operations](https://github.com/icanboogie/operation), [internationalization](https://github.com/icanboogie/cldr), [translation](https://github.com/icanboogie/i18n), [ActiveRecord](https://github.com/icanboogie/activerecord), [facets](https://github.com/icanboogie/facets), [mailer](https://github.com/icanboogie/mailer)â€¦

Together with [Brickrouge](http://brickrouge.org) and [Patron](https://github.com/Icybee/Patron),
**ICanBoogie** is one of the components that make the CMS [Icybee](http://icybee.org). You might want
to check these projects too.





### What does _micro_ mean?

_"Micro"_ means that the core features of ICanBoogie are kept to the essential, the core is simple
but greatly extensible. For instance, ICanBoogie won't force an ORM on you, although its
[ActiveRecord](https://github.com/ICanBoogie/ActiveRecord) implementation is pretty nice. In the
same fashion, its routing mechanisms are quite agnostic and let you use your very own
dispatcher if you want to.





### Configuration and conventions

ICanBoogie and its components are usually very configurable and come with sensible defaults and a
few conventions. Configurations are usually located in "config" folders, while locale messages are
usually located in "locale" folders. Components configure themselves thanks to ICanBoogie's
[Autoconfig][] feature, and won't require much of you other than a line in your
`composer.json` file.

## Routes

The package provides a controller for the `/api/ping` route, which may be used to renew a session,
if one existed in the first place. When the `timer` query parameter is present, the controller
gives timing information as well.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;

$request = Request::from('/api/ping?timer');

echo $request()->body;
// pong, in 4.875 ms (ready in 3.172 ms)
```





## Helpers

The following helper functions are defined:

- `app()`: Returns the [Application][] instance, or throws [ApplicationNotInstantiated][] if it has
not been instantiated yet.
- `boot()`: Instantiates a [Application][] instance with the _autoconfig_ and boots it.
- `log()`: Logs a debug message.
- `log_success()`: Logs a success message.
- `log_error()`: Logs an error message.
- `log_info()`: Logs an info message.
- `log_time()`: Logs a debug message associated with a timing information.





----------





## Installation

```bash
composer require icanboogie/icanboogie
```

Don't forget to modify the _script_ section of your "composer.json" file if you want to benefit
from the _autoconfig_ feature:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "post-autoload-dump": "ICanBoogie\\Autoconfig\\Hooks::on_autoload_dump"
    }
}
```

## Documentation

The documentation for the package and its dependencies can be generated with the `make doc`

The package directory can later by cleaned with the `make clean` command.

The documentation for the complete framework is also available online: <https://icanboogie.org/docs/>





## Testing

Run `make test-container` to create and log into the test container, then run `make test` to run the
test suite. Alternatively, run `make test-coverage` to run the test suite with test coverage. Open
`build/coverage/index.html` to see the breakdown of the code coverage.
